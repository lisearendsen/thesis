We have created a library that formalizes the modal $\mu$-calculus in Isabelle/HOL. This library captures both basic results as well as proofs from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08060). 

# Dependencies
We make use of the formalization of [Regular Expressions](https://www.isa-afp.org/sessions/regular-sets/#Regular_Exp) by Tobias Nipkow.
A guide on how to link the Archive of Formal Proofs can be found [here](https://www.isa-afp.org/help/).
